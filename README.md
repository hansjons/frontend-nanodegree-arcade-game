## Running the game

Clone the repository to your machine and cd into the game directory. Doubleclick index.html.

## Mission

The mission is to get each character to the water without running into any of the beetles.

## Playing the game

The game is started by pressing the space bar. As soon as it starts beetles drift across the screen seemingly
eager to get to the other side. Using the arrow key's up, down, left, right you can move your character in
those directions within the game console. You must look at not to be in the way of the beetles as then you loose
and the game is over. However if you manage to get the first character over to the water the next character
appears in the start position.

Getting all the characters over to the water wins the game. So how many characters are there? Well why don't you
play the game and find out?


## Control

You control the movement of the characters with the arrow keys.
